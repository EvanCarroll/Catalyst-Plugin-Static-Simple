        - Added tests for everything except Apache support.

0.07    2005-09-05 21:05:00
        - POD fixes. (Thomas L. Shinnick)

0.06    2005-09-05 15:40:00
        - Moved initial file check into prepare_action so processing can
          bypass other plugins.
        - Added error-checking to static dir regexes.
        - Cleaned up various code as per Best Practices.

0.05    2005-08-26 12:00:00
        - Added use_apache option to enable the Apache DECLINED
          support.  Default is disabled as it appears Catalyst is
          faster at serving the files!
        - Added a check that Apache's DocumentRoot matches Catalyst's
          root before serving DECLINED.
        - Preload MIME::Types index during setup() so it's not built on
          the first request.
        - Added a note on performance of Apache vs. Catalyst.

0.04    2005-08-22 12:00:00
        - Fixed bug where static files were searched for on every request
          even without a file extension.
        - Fixed bug where files without extensions in defined static dirs
          were not served with text/plain.
        - Consolidated the debug log messages.

0.03    2005-08-21 23:50:00
        - Added config option for include_path to allow for multiple 
          directories with static files.  This option should be
          considered experimental!
        - Documentation cleanups.

0.02    2005-08-16 18:00:00
        - Return DECLINED when running under mod_perl to allow Apache to
          serve the static file.  This is not done when any custom MIME
          types have been specified, however.

0.01    2005-08-11 22:00:00
        - Initial release.
